# Using semantic segmentation for detecting damage on a steel plate.

This repository contains the notebook of the model and EDA for the <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/c/severstal-steel-defect-detection'> Kaggle competition </a>. The main goal was to identify defects on a steel plate to improve quality.For this task a model was trained for predicting the class and type of the damage occurred on a steel plate right after manufacturing. Model attained an accuracy of 76%.

In the process of building the model I read and implemented several models like U-net <https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597>, seg-net <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.00561.pdf>, squeeze-segnet <https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.05491>. Apart from this hyper-parameter tuning and optimization techniques were used to improve model score.
